# AWS LightSail to DigitalOcean

The reason I decided to move from LightSail to DigitalOcean is Dokku tells me to use root, which LightSail does not allow me to.
While DigitalOcean does, the cheapest VPS from it is $4 for 1 CPU, 512MB, and meager 10GB SSD. The cheapest one from LightSail offers
2! CPU, 512MB, and 20GB SSD, whose half is already used from the beginning.
